            <h2>About Audio Timeliner</h2>
            <p>
            Audio Timeliner is an audio annotation and analysis tool for creating and labeling bubble diagrams. These diagrams can be used to navigate music or other audio for detailed study. 
			<span lang="en-us">This tool has been used by many colleges and 
			universities for the purpose of music analysis.</span></p>
			<p>
            This tool was <span lang="en-us">originally developed as the 
			Variations Audio Timeliner </span>by the Indiana University Digital Library Program as part of the Variations<span lang="en-us">3
			</span>digital music library project. <span lang="en-us">This 
			updated version (by the original principal author) removes the 
			Quicktime element (for compatibility with Macs) and is no longer 
			associated with the Variations project. </span>
            </p>

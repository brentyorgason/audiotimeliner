# Audio Timeliner
Audio Timeliner is an audio annotation and analysis tool for creating and labeling bubble diagrams. These diagrams can be used to navigate music or other audio for detailed study.

This tool has been used by many colleges and universities for the purpose of music analysis. It was originally developed as the Variations Audio Timeliner by the Indiana University Digital Library Program as part of the Variations digital music library project. 

This updated version (by the original principal author) removes the Quicktime element (for compatibility with Macs) and is no longer associated with the Variations project.
